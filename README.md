# friends

Challenge: I have some friends records in a text file (friends.json) -- one friend per line, JSON-encoded. I want to invite any friends within 100km of our Bangalore office which is almost like our home (GPS coordinates 12.9611159,77.6362214) for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of friends and output the names and user ids of matching friends (within 100km), sorted by user id (ascending).
 
You can use the first formula from this Wikipedia article to calculate distance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance -- don't forget, you'll need to convert degrees to radians.

Friends list is available in the friends.json

Happy Coding!
